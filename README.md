# white-balance-algorithms
Implementations of Gray-Card, Gray World Assumption and White World Assumption algorithms

This notebook is prepared for Computer Vision homework.

There are mainly two parts.

Part-1

Estimating the inverse function for IPhone-XR for captured images in order to get Raw RGB values.

Part-2

Implementing 3 different white balancing algorithms

1. Gray Card
2. Gray World Assumption
3. White World Assumption
